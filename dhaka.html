                    Dhaka formerly known as Dacca, is the capital and the largest city of Bangladesh, as well as the
                    largest city in the Bengal region. It is the ninth-largest and the sixth-most densely populous city
                    in the world with, as of 2011, a population of 8.9 million residents within the city limits, and
                    a population of over 21 million residents in the Greater Dhaka Area. Dhaka is the economic,
                    political, and cultural center of Bangladesh, and is one of the major cities in South Asia, the
                    largest city in Eastern South Asia and among the Bay of Bengal countries; and one of the largest
                    cities among OIC countries. As part of the Bengal plain, the city is bounded by the Buriganga River,
                    Turag River, Dhaleshwari River and Shitalakshya River.

                    The area of Dhaka has been inhabited since the first millennium. Dhaka is the financial, commercial
                    and the entertainment capital of Bangladesh, and accounts for up
                    to 35% of Bangladesh's economy. Since its establishment as a modern capital city the population,
                    area, social and economic diversity of Dhaka have grown tremendously. The city is now one of the
                    most densely industrialized regions in Bangladesh. Dhaka is a major beta-global city, as it
                    hosts the headquarters of several international corporations. By the 21st century, it emerged as a
                    megacity.
